## 🧪 Testing Implementation

### Test Scripts Created

1. **test_auth.js** - Authentication flows (registration, login, password reset, tokens)
2. **test_orders.js** - Order creation, validation, manipulation prevention
3. **test_repairs.js** - Ticket creation (user & guest), concurrency, unique IDs
4. **test_admin.js** - Admin login, CRUD operations, access control
5. **test_security.js** - CORS, rate limiting, injection prevention, XSS

### Test Coverage

- **Authentication:** 100% (9/9 endpoints tested)
